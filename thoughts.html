        <li><h3>Smooth scrolling on the Mac</h3>I have been using a Mac for the last couple of years, using its trackpad or the Apple Magic Mouse. Recently, I switched to a Logitech MX Master 2S. I notice a big difference in the scrolling experience between Apple and non-Apple peripherals. It's like I went from a round-wheeled bicycle to a square-wheeled one. Things like these make Apple products feel like magic and are a differentiating factor for me. <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/scrolling-with-pleasure/" target="_blank">Pavel Fatin seems to know more about this</a>(I have not yet read the entire article myself).</li>

        <li><h3>Everything sounds cooler in English than in Romanian</h3>Take my hometown for example, Lunca Cetățuii- <em>Meadow Fortress</em>, or Ion Fieraru- <em>John Smith</em>. I'm not sure whether this is a generally observed phenomena among Romanians.</li>
