        <h1>Alexandru Cristiean</h1>
        <p>
        I was born and raised in Lunca Cetățuii, Ciurea, Iași, Romania. Since
        September 2016 I have been living in Brighton, England, UK.
        </p>
        <p>
        I study Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the Univeristy
        of Sussex. After an unexpected temporary withdrawal, I will resume the
        second year of my course in September 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
        Most of my time is spent working at StoryStream and organising HackSussex.
        </p>
        <p>
        I exercise, run, play badminton, swim and generally try to live
        healthily. However, I keep falling for high sugar intakes.
