    <h1>Alexandru Cristiean</h1>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Lunca Cetățuii,
        <a href="ciurea.html"> Ciurea Commune</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iași_County">Iași County</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</a>.
        In September 2016 I had moved to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton">Brighton</a>
        and have been living there ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        I study <a
            href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-bsc">
            Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence</a> at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sussex">Univeristy
            of Sussex</a>. After temporary withdrawing due to unexpected
        reasons, I will resume the second year of my course in September 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my time is spent working at <a href="https://storystream.ai">
            StorySteram</a>, organising <a href="https://hacksussex.co.uk">
            HackSussex</a> and <del>overthinking</del> organising my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I exercise, run, play badminton, swim and generally try to live
        healthily. However, I keep falling for high sugar intakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to visit Switzerland, Canada, and the West and East coasts of
        America. If I really like any of those places, I might end up settling
        there.
