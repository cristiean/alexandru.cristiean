    <h1>Alexandru Cristiean</h1>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Lunca Cetățuii,
        <a href="ciurea.html"> Ciurea Commune</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iași_County">Iași County</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</a>.
        In September 2016 I moved to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton">Brighton</a>
        and have been living here ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently enrolled in the <a
            href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-bsc">
            Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence</a> at the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sussex">Univeristy
            of Sussex</a>, I will resume the second year of my studies in
        September 2019 after an unexpected break due to personal reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my time is spent working at <a href="https://storystream.ai">
            StorySteram</a>, organising <a href="https://hacksussex.co.uk">
            HackSussex</a> and <del>overthinking</del> organising my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to keep active, get enough sleep and eat well. However, I
        fall for sugary products more often than I'd like.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the near future I want to visit Switzerland, Canada, and the West 
        and East coasts of the US.
