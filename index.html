        <h1>Alexandru Cristiean</h1>
        <p>
        I was born and raised in Lunca Cetățuii, Ciurea, Iași, Romania. I have
        been living in Brighton, England, UK since September 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
        I study Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the Univeristy
        of Sussex. After an unexpected temporary withdrawal, I will resume the
        second year of my course in September 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
        Most of my time is spent working at StoryStream, organising HackSussex,
        and <del>overthinking</del> arranging things in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
        I exercise, run, play badminton, swim and generally try to live
        healthily. However, I keep falling for high sugar intakes.
        </p>
        <p>
        I want to visit Switzerland, Canada, and the West and East coasts of
        America. If I really like any of those places, I might end up settling
        there.
